The design solution consisted of a Single Page Application using AngularJS and Bootstrap 4. It features animated page transitions, embedded soundcloud audio tracks, a pinterest-style image lightbox gallery, Bootstrap modals to showcase performance dates and band posters (also Mason Media design), with unique banner images and branding. The site was also an exercise in Atomic CSS, with an effort to limit styles to native Bootstrap 4 classes."
