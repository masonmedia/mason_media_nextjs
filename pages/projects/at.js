Requirements included a simple, intuitive user interface, a low amount of scrolling while still presenting a large amount of content, a specific typeface, and the firm's existing logo/color palette. I went with a simple one-page layout centering on jQuery clickable dropdown panels which revealed text for each subsection, with futher features including flexbox construction, a side-canvas menu, smooth anchor scrolling, and image sourcing."

Having worked with React on numerous recent projects I was tired of the tooling and setup, so built a similar component-based architecture using PHP. The site employs reusable HTML components with PHP variables that allow for SPA-style data binding customization. The site also uses SWUP, SASS, Bootstrap, AOS, Undraw illustations, and an expanded gradient color palette. Advance also required UX copywriting and editing."
